        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Types of Poisoning</h3>
        <p><strong>Acute Poisoning:</strong> Refers to the immediate effects of ingesting or inhaling a toxic substance. Symptoms can be severe and may include nausea, vomiting, difficulty breathing, dizziness, or loss of consciousness. Treatment depends on the substance and may involve induced vomiting, activated charcoal, or intravenous fluids.</p>
        <p><strong>Chronic Poisoning:</strong> Occurs when low doses of a toxic substance are accumulated over time, leading to gradual poisoning. Examples include lead poisoning, carbon monoxide poisoning, and long-term exposure to pesticides. Chronic poisoning may require long-term treatment or monitoring.</p>
        <p><strong>Food Poisoning:</strong> Caused by the ingestion of contaminated food or drink, leading to symptoms such as stomach cramps, diarrhea, vomiting, and fever. Common culprits include bacteria like Salmonella, E. coli, or Norovirus.</p>
        <p><strong>Drug Overdose:</strong> Can occur from taking too much of a prescribed or illegal drug. It may involve substances such as opioids, acetaminophen, or alcohol. Symptoms vary but may include confusion, unconsciousness, seizures, or irregular heartbeat.</p>
        <p><strong>Carbon Monoxide Poisoning:</strong> Inhalation of carbon monoxide, a colorless, odorless gas, can result in poisoning. Symptoms may include headaches, dizziness, nausea, and confusion. Treatment requires immediate removal from the exposure and administration of pure oxygen.</p>
        <p><strong>Chemical Poisoning:</strong> Includes exposure to hazardous chemicals such as household cleaners, pesticides, or industrial chemicals. Ingesting, inhaling, or skin contact with these chemicals can lead to poisoning, which requires immediate medical treatment to prevent serious health effects.</p>

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Common Poisons</h3>
        <p><strong>Household Products:</strong> Many everyday items in the home, such as cleaning products, pesticides, and even plants, can be toxic if ingested or inhaled. Keeping these items out of reach of children and pets can reduce the risk of poisoning.</p>
        <p><strong>Carbon Monoxide:</strong> Produced by burning fuel, this gas can be harmful in confined spaces. Symptoms of exposure include headache, dizziness, and confusion. It's often mistaken for other conditions, so itâ€™s important to seek medical help if symptoms occur after exposure to a potential source of CO.</p>
        <p><strong>Medications:</strong> Overdose of medications, whether prescription, over-the-counter, or recreational drugs, can lead to poisoning. Opioids, benzodiazepines, and acetaminophen are examples of medications that can cause overdose and potentially fatal consequences if misused.</p>
        <p><strong>Heavy Metals:</strong> Lead, mercury, and arsenic are examples of heavy metals that can poison the body if accumulated over time. Symptoms include digestive issues, neurological problems, and developmental delays in children. Blood tests are often needed to diagnose heavy metal poisoning.</p>

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Treatment and Management</h3>
        <p><strong>Activated Charcoal:</strong> In cases of poisoning from substances that have been ingested, activated charcoal can be used to absorb the toxins in the stomach and intestines, preventing further absorption into the bloodstream. It is most effective when administered within an hour of ingestion.</p>
        <p><strong>Induced Vomiting:</strong> If poisoning has occurred within a short period, doctors may induce vomiting to remove the toxic substance from the stomach. This is not always appropriate, especially for caustic substances, and should only be done under medical supervision.</p>
        <p><strong>Gastric Lavage:</strong> In severe cases of poisoning, gastric lavage (stomach pumping) may be performed to remove toxic substances from the stomach. This is done in a hospital setting with appropriate monitoring.</p>
        <p><strong>Antidotes:</strong> For certain poisons, specific antidotes are available to neutralize the effects. For example, Naloxone is used to reverse opioid overdoses, and atropine is used to treat organophosphate poisoning (such as from pesticide exposure).</p>
        <p><strong>Oxygen Therapy:</strong> In cases of carbon monoxide poisoning or other respiratory toxicities, oxygen therapy is used to help the body clear the poison more quickly by delivering pure oxygen to the lungs.</p>

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Prevention and Safety Measures</h3>
        <p><strong>Safe Storage:</strong> Keep toxic substances, including cleaning products, medicines, and chemicals, in locked cabinets or out of reach of children and pets.</p>
        <p><strong>Proper Ventilation:</strong> Ensure that areas with potential sources of toxic fumes, such as stoves, furnaces, or garages, are well-ventilated to avoid carbon monoxide buildup.</p>
        <p><strong>Labeling and Instructions:</strong> Always read the labels of household products and medications, and follow the instructions carefully. Never mix chemicals unless specified on the label.</p>
        <p><strong>Preventing Food Poisoning:</strong> Practice safe food handling, including washing hands, cooking foods to safe temperatures, and avoiding cross-contamination between raw and cooked foods.</p>
        <p><strong>Education and Awareness:</strong> Educate your family, especially children, about the dangers of consuming non-food items and the importance of seeking help if they have ingested something toxic.</p>
