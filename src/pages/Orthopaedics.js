            Time has changed. The Department of Orthopaedics at Mahua Medanta Hospital is a centre of excellence in Joint Replacement, Trauma, and Arthroscopy & Spine surgery. Our dedicated Orthopaedic surgeons have received training from top institutes in the country and abroad. 
            We are equipped with state-of-the-art modular operation theatres, laminar air flow, and the latest instruments, ensuring the best possible results in surgical outcomes and patient care.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Fracture Clinics are run daily for patients referred through A&E, and we also have a dedicated direct referral line for GPs. This allows for follow-up treatment without the need to visit A&E again, making the access pathway faster and easier for our patients.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Our mission is to provide highly evidence-based treatment plans with a combination of engineering-like approaches for accuracy and safety. We also offer specialized care from orthopaedic spine and pediatric orthopaedic surgeons.

            Orthopaedics is the study of the musculoskeletal system. Our surgeons specialize in diagnosing and treating musculoskeletal issues.
