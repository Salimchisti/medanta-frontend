        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold">The Emergency Response Process</h3>
        <p>Our emergency response system is designed to handle any urgent medical situation effectively and efficiently. Here's how the process works:</p>
        
        <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold">1. Immediate Assessment</h4>
        <p>Once a medical emergency is identified, the first step is to quickly assess the patient's condition. This can occur through an initial phone call or through our in-house emergency staff who assess patients in the emergency department. The primary focus is to identify the severity of the condition and prioritize care accordingly.</p>
        
        <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold">2. Emergency Medical Dispatch</h4>
        <p>Our team of emergency medical professionals is always on standby. Once the emergency situation is confirmed, an ambulance team is dispatched to the location if needed. The emergency medical dispatch team communicates important details to ensure the team arrives prepared and equipped with necessary medical tools and supplies.</p>
        
        <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold">3. On-Site Care</h4>
        <p>If the emergency team arrives at the scene (e.g., an accident site or home), they provide immediate stabilization, assess injuries, manage pain, and determine the best course of action. This could involve administering life-saving treatments, applying bandages or splints, managing airway, or even performing CPR if necessary.</p>

        <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold">4. Hospital Transport</h4>
        <p>If the patient requires further medical intervention, transport to the hospital is arranged. Our ambulances are equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment and staffed by trained paramedics or emergency medical technicians (EMTs) who continue treatment while en route to the hospital.</p>

        <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold">5. Emergency Room Care</h4>
        <p>Upon arrival at the emergency department (ER), a team of emergency physicians, nurses, and specialists assesses the patient. Diagnostic tests (e.g., blood tests, X-rays, CT scans) are performed to evaluate the extent of the condition, and immediate treatment plans are established. Depending on the severity of the case, further intervention like surgery, intensive care, or observation may be necessary.</p>

        <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold">6. Post-Emergency Care</h4>
        <p>Once the patient is stabilized, they may be admitted to the hospital for further care or sent home with instructions for follow-up care. In cases of life-threatening conditions, they may be transferred to specialized units such as the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or undergo long-term rehabilitation and recovery.</p>

        <p>Effective emergency response is crucial because:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
          <li><strong>Time is of the Essence:</strong> Many medical conditions, such as heart attacks, strokes, or trauma, require immediate attention to minimize long-term effects or even save lives.</li>
          <li><strong>Prevention of Complications:</strong> Timely medical intervention can prevent further complications or worsening of the condition, especially in critical situations like bleeding, respiratory failure, or sepsis.</li>
          <li><strong>Rapid Diagnosis:</strong> Quick and accurate diagnosis allows for immediate treatment, which can significantly improve patient outcomes.</li>
          <li><strong>Improved Recovery Rates:</strong> The quicker a patient receives emergency care, the better their chances of a full recovery.</li>
        </ul>
