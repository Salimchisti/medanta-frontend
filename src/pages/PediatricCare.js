        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Pediatric Care for Different Stages of Childhood</h3>
        <p>Pediatric care varies depending on the age and stage of the child. Here's how our approach changes as children grow:</p>

        <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold">Infants (0-1 year)</h4>
        <p>During infancy, the focus is on monitoring growth and development, breastfeeding or formula feeding, sleep patterns, and the early stages of immunizations. Pediatricians ensure infants hit key milestones and receive the necessary vaccinations for protection against diseases.</p>

        <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold">Toddlers (1-3 years)</h4>
        <p>As toddlers start to explore, pediatric care emphasizes motor skills, speech development, and potty training. Health checks ensure they grow and develop appropriately while introducing important vaccines and preventive care.</p>

        <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold">Children (4-12 years)</h4>
        <p>During this stage, children become more active and develop social skills. Pediatricians monitor growth, provide vaccinations, and address any behavioral or health issues that arise, such as allergies, asthma, or learning difficulties.</p>

        <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold">Adolescents (13-18 years)</h4>
        <p>Adolescence brings significant physical, emotional, and hormonal changes. Pediatric care at this stage focuses on mental health, nutrition, sexual health, and helping teens manage conditions like acne, stress, or weight management while preparing them for adulthood.</p>
