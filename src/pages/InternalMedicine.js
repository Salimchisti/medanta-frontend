        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold">What is Internal Medicine?</h3>
        <p><strong>Internal Medicine</strong> is a medical specialty focused on the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases that affect adults. Internists, also known as doctors of internal medicine, are trained to diagnose and manage a wide range of health conditions that impact the internal organs, such as the heart, lungs, liver, and kidneys. Unlike specialists who focus on a specific organ or system, internists are experts in treating the whole person and managing complex or multi-system diseases.</p>

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Role of an Internist</h3>
        <p>Internists serve as primary care providers for adult patients and are often the first point of contact when a patient experiences health issues. They play a key role in:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5">

          <li><strong>Coordination of Care:</strong> When necessary, internists coordinate care with specialists and other healthcare providers to ensure comprehensive treatment for complex conditions.</li>
          <li><strong>Health Promotion and Disease Prevention:</strong> They emphasize the importance of preventive care, including lifestyle changes, vaccinations, screenings, and health counseling to reduce the risk of diseases.</li>
        </ul>
